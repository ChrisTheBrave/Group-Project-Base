# Airbnb Listing in Chicago
# Description

When accessing an Airbnb website, it can be laborious to find data about the previous Airbnb reservation in Chicago. To solve this issue, we created a website that shows the rapid analyses of past Airbnb reservations in Chicago. While it is likely that Airbnb has access to analyses tools for their data at their offices, a web-based portal would allow them to better present data to potential hosts and potentially give hosts a method of reviewing data on their previous reservations in an interesting way. This portal should also be complemented by data insert and update capabilities, allowing Airbnb to add new or missing records and change records without having to return to the office.
